/support user#0000 [hour limit for video games] [day limit for message]
/support <user.id> (if you have discord developer mode enabled) [hour limit for video games] [ day limit for message ]
This system will dm said person a message about the program where they can accept or decline your invitation to be accountability partners. This program can help each user in several ways. 
Using the first optional argument of the command (default value 40 hours), Harmony will keep track of how long each user plays games and if it goes over the designated weekly threshold it will inform the accountability partner that they are over the time. 
Using the second optional argument of the command (default value 7 days), Harmony will keep track of how long user has not sent a message, and in a certain number of days it will inform the other partner that they may need to check in on their friend.
In addition, Harmony observes each userâ€™s message data and based off the type of words the user says it will report a positivity rating on their chats as well as send the sender notifications if a message is too aggressive. Harmony also has a command 
/positivity @user 
that will allow for Harmony to crawl through an entire text channel to see how positive a user has been.
Harmony also has a feature that tries to stop you from playing video games when you should be doing something else, like being in class. Use
/class [single letter day name (For example, M for monday, R for Thursday, U for Sunday)] [Time period in military time (For example 21:00-22:00)] [three letter time zone (For example CST)]`)
